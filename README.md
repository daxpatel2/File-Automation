## About Me

Hello, I'm Dax Patel, and I'm passionate about automating tasks and making life easier through coding. Below, you'll find a brief introduction to one of my projects:

### File Automation Script

- **Description:** This Python script is designed to help you organize files in a directory automatically. It categorizes files into different folders based on their file types (documents, images, and software) and logs the operations in a log file.

#### Features:

- Categorizes files into three main categories: documents, images, and software.
- Handles various file types like .doc, .jpg, .exe, and more.
- Logs all operations, including successful moves and any errors.
- Organizes files efficiently, making it easier to manage and find them.

#### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Place the script in the directory containing the files you want to organize.
3. Run the script(additional instructions included in the files), and it will categorize and move the files accordingly.

#### Contributions:

I welcome contributions to this project! Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests to enhance the functionality or fix any bugs.

Thank you for checking out my project! If you find it useful or have any feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
